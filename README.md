This program consists of developing a game similar to Niantic's Pokémon GO but in the environment of the IntelliJ IDEA encoding in Java. The game mimics the system of Pokémon GO, in which we must try to capture all the Pokémon that are there by buying different balls with which we will have the opportunity to catch the different Pokémon we are looking for.

In addition, to capture Mythical Pokémon, different capture missions will have to be carried out. And to capture the legendary ones, we have to enter the coordinates where we are in order to find the gym we have closest to us and be able to challenge the legendary Pokémon that guards it.

The game will allow you to search for information on the different Pokémon, generating an html file where the most relevant data of the selected Pokémon will appear.

Finally, an html file can be generated that will inform us how many Pokémon we have hunted of each type, as well as the total catches.
